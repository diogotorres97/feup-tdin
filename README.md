# feup-tdin

Repository to host Distribution and Integration Technologies projects. Made  in collaboration with [@Quaresma1997](https://github.com/Quaresma1997).

## Assignment 1

The developed project consists of an intranet distributed application capable of automatize the restaurant needs. It was developed using the C# Language more specifically .NET Remoting and WinForms was used in the GUI.

A restaurant needs to automatize the dining room orders, allowing them to be quickly communicated to the kitchen and bar tends, to be prepared as soon as possible. Also, it was necessary to maintain a complete record of all orders, compute the bills of each table and maintain a record of the total amount received in the day. With this in mind, the application implements all of these features in an intuitive and pleasant way for the final user.

## Assignment 2

The developed project consists of an enterprise distributed system capable of managing a bookstore in which it’s responsible for managing sells, orders and stock. It was developed using the principles of a service-oriented architecture (SOA) and consists essentially of two large modules: the store module and the warehouse module.

A  bookstore needs to coordinate the sells (made in the physical store) and the orders (coming from the online store or the physical store), allowing them to be quickly processed to the client. When a user makes a sell/order, the bookstore needs to process the request. Processing a request consists of checking if the stock is sufficient to satisfy the sell/order, if not a request stock to the warehouse is made, and after that it’s delivered to the client. With this in mind, the system implements all the necessary requirements for its operation presenting them in an intuitive and pleasant way for the final user (clients and employees).
